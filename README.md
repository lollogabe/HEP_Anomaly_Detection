Anomaly Detection in High-Energy Physics using Deep Autoencoders🔬 Project OverviewThis project applies Deep Learning techniques to a fundamental problem in High-Energy Physics (HEP): detecting anomalous hadronic jets produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).At extreme energies, massive particles decay into hadronic jets that are highly collimated. Distinguishing whether a jet substructure originates from a known Standard Model particle (background) or a potential new massive particle (signal/anomaly) is a complex task.We implemented a Convolutional Autoencoder (CNN-AE) to perform unsupervised anomaly detection, training the model to reconstruct "normal" jets and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction error and latent space analysis.🎯 Key ObjectivesUnsupervised Learning: Train a model exclusively on Standard Model background data (QCD jets).Architecture: Design a Convolutional Autoencoder capable of compressing 2D calorimeter images into a dense latent representation.Anomaly Scoring: Compare different metrics for outlier detection:MSE (Reconstruction Loss): $L = ||x - \hat{x}||^2$Mahalanobis Distance: Calculated in the latent space.Latent Space Analysis: Use PCA and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to interpret how the network organizes physical features.🛠️ Methodology & Tech StackFrameworks: Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib.Data Input: 2D images ($100 \times 100$ pixels) representing energy deposits in calorimeter cells.Model Architecture: * Encoder: 3 Convolutional blocks + MaxPool + Linear projection to $\mathbb{R}^{10}$.Decoder: Mirrored structure with ConvTranspose layers to reconstruct the input.Optimization: Adam Optimizer, MSE Loss.📊 Results1. Reconstruction Loss AnalysisThe model successfully learned to reconstruct background jets with low error, while failing to reconstruct anomalous jets (signals). This discrepancy allows for effective signal-background separation.Note: Replace this line with a screenshot of your histogram (Blue/Red/Green plot) from the notebook.2. Latent Space VisualizationBy projecting the 10-dimensional latent space onto 2D using PCA, we observed distinct clustering behaviors between the background and the anomalous signals, validating the model's feature extraction capabilities.Note: Replace this line with a screenshot of your PCA/Latent space scatter plot.3. PerformanceFalse Positive Rate (FPR): Maintained $\le 10\%$ on background data.Signal Discrimination: We confirmed the physical hypothesis that higher mass particles ($f_{high}$) result in higher reconstruction errors compared to lower mass anomalies ($f_{low}$), i.e., $f_{high} > f_{low}$.📂 Data AvailabilityThe dataset used in this project consists of simulated LHC events provided by Prof. Stefano Giagu for the "Machine Learning in Physics" course at Sapienza University of Rome / CERN.Due to course policies and the educational nature of the dataset:The source code is fully available in this repository.The raw data files (.npz) are not distributed here.The code includes a placeholder get_data() function. If you have access to the specific CERN/Sapienza servers, you can restore the download links to reproduce the results.🚀 UsageClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/HEP_Anomaly_Detection.git](https://github.com/yourusername/HEP_Anomaly_Detection.git)
